- user and admin features where they each have different screens

- users and admins can edit their log in details
#### 17th Apr 2024 update
- i have not done shit for a long time because i've been thinking of adding in tkinter and making it actually interactive instead of just terminal based, but then i started thinking of changing it completely to make it to be a whole app. however i will not be so ambitious and will only add tkinter. will take time to learn it fr tho
- tldr: adding tkinter to this after i learn to use it lol
